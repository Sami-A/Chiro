## What Is The Use (Person I Don't Know)? 

Well, if you work sitting down for long hours or sleep the wrong way, at some point, you may feel pain or discomfort in some areas of your body. By default, your body needs movement throughout the day to compensate for all the sitting and sleeping you do. Hence, this web app will give you useful exercises and workout sessions to help you avoid some of the pitfalls that come with it.
